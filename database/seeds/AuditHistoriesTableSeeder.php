May the Force be with you. Kid, I&rsquo;ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I&rsquo;ve never seen anything to make me believe there&rsquo;s one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There&rsquo;s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It&rsquo;s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. He is here. Ye-ha! I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Look, I ain&rsquo;t in this for your revolution, and I&rsquo;m not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I&rsquo;m in it for the money. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han.&nbsp;I guess that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re best at,&nbsp;ain&rsquo;t it? Alderaan? I&rsquo;m not going to Alderaan. I&rsquo;ve got to go home. It&rsquo;s late, I&rsquo;m in for it as it is.
