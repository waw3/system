<p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Kid, I&rsquo;ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I&rsquo;ve never seen anything to make me believe there&rsquo;s one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There&rsquo;s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It&rsquo;s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. He is here. Ye-ha! I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t believe in the Force, do you? Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I call it luck. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&rsquo;re going. What?! The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</p>

<p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Look, I ain&rsquo;t in this for your revolution, and I&rsquo;m not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I&rsquo;m in it for the money. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>

<p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Kid, I&rsquo;ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I&rsquo;ve never seen anything to make me believe there&rsquo;s one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There&rsquo;s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It&rsquo;s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. He is here. Ye-ha! I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>

<p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Look, I ain&rsquo;t in this for your revolution, and I&rsquo;m not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I&rsquo;m in it for the money. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>

<p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han.&nbsp;I guess that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re best at,&nbsp;ain&rsquo;t it? Alderaan? I&rsquo;m not going to Alderaan. I&rsquo;ve got to go home. It&rsquo;s late, I&rsquo;m in for it as it is. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</p>

You don&rsquo;t believe in the Force, do you? Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I call it luck. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&rsquo;re going. What?! The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</p>

<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&rsquo;m getting too old for this sort of thing. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. No!

You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&rsquo;re going.</p>

<p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Dantooine. They&rsquo;re on Dantooine. You&rsquo;re all clear, kid. Let&rsquo;s blow this thing and go home! I&rsquo;m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. I&rsquo;m trying not to, kid.</p>

<p>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Don&rsquo;t underestimate the Force. I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&ndash; I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re all clear, kid.&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s blow this thing and go home!&nbsp;But with the blast shield down, I can&rsquo;t even see! How am I supposed to fight? Alderaan? I&rsquo;m not going to Alderaan. I&rsquo;ve got to go home. It&rsquo;s late, I&rsquo;m in for it as it is.</p>

<p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han.&nbsp;I guess that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re best at,&nbsp;ain&rsquo;t it? Alderaan? I&rsquo;m not going to Alderaan. I&rsquo;ve got to go home. It&rsquo;s late, I&rsquo;m in for it as it is. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</p>
